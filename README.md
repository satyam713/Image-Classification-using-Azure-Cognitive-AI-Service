## Introduction to Custom Computer Vision
Azure AI Custom Vision is an image recognition service that allows users to build, deploy, and improve image identifier models. It applies labels to images based on their visual characteristics, automating the sorting and categorization of visual data, which is essential in various industries, from healthcare to manufacturing.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Azure Services:**
  - Azure Resource Group
  - Azure Storage Account (Blob Storage)
  - Azure Multi-service Account
  - Azure Vision Studio
- **Model Training Platform:**
  - Custom Image Classification model training using Azure Vision Studio
- **Programming Languages/Tools:**
  - Python or C# on VS Code

## Project Workflow
1. **Set Up Environment:**
   - Create a Resource Group in the Azure portal.
   
2. **Storage Account & Blob Container:**
   - Set up a Storage Account and add a container for training images and JSON files.

3. **Prepare and Train Data:**
   - Upload training images and modify the JSON file for labeling. 
   - Create a new project in Custom Vision AI, upload the images, and train the model.
